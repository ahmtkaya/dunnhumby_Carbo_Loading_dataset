# dunnhumby_Carbo_Loading_dataset: A Relational Database
### What’s inside?
Household level transactions over a period of two years from four categories: Pasta, Pasta Sauce, Syrup, and Pancake Mix
### What’s it for?
Classroom projects and case studies
Understanding the process required to mine data
Learning how to merge data tables and aggregate data
### Who's it from?
This dataset was developed with the assistance of:
Carrie Heilman   
Associate Professor of Marketing,
University of Virginia

### How should I use it?
Professors have had success asking students questions such as:

#### What is the household penetration of Product X? That is, out of all customers purchasing Pasta Sauce, what percent purchase Product X or Brand Z?
#### Did any customers first purchase an item or category using a coupon? If so, how many of these customers made additional purchases of the item or category?
In two complementary categories (e.g. Pasta and Pasta Sauce), what products, if any, are commonly purchased together?
Special considerations
Don't forget, you're dealing with Big Data! Large file sizes may take 5+ minutes to download, and importing the millions of rows of data contained within will require specialised software such as R, Microsoft Excel with PowerPivot, Microsoft Access, SAS, SPSS, SQL, etc.
